#' @format A data frame containing 535 rows and 22 variables.
#' \describe{
#'   \item{FrogID}{Individuals are identified with a 5-digit code. The first two digits indicate the year in which that female was collected and tested, while the next three digits are a unique identifier. }
#'   \item{AlternativeCD, AlternativeCR, AlternativeDF, AlternativeRA, AlternativePR}{We manipulated five call traits, and each female was given an alternative stimulus with a unique combination of these five traits. The trait values specific to each female are given in columns 2-6: “AlternativeCD” (call duration), ”AlternativeCR” (call rate), “AlternativeDF” (dominant frequency), “AlternativeRA” (relative amplitude), and “AlternativePR” (pulse rate).}

#' Academic Word List
#'
#' The Academic Word List (AWL) was developed by Averil Coxhead as her MA thesis at the School of Linguistics and Applied Language Studies at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The list contains 570 word families which were selected according to principles. The list does not include words that are in the most frequent 2000 words of English. The AWL was primarily made so that it could be used by teachers as part of a programme preparing learners for tertiary level study or used by students working alone to learn the words most needed to study at tertiary institutions. The Academic Word List replaces the University Word List.
